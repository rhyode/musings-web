## What are Musings?

Google says - a period of reflection or thought. For our context, I would extend the 
meaning a little bit to - my thoughts, knowledge, experience on things I do, feel or
like in everyday life, I just jot down those for readers with the goal of providing 
value to anyone who is reading my articles. I make sure to be write well researched 
content in case of any kinds of facts and health related concepts.
